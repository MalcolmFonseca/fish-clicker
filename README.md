	- jellyfish
	- manta ray
	- eel/moray eel
	- turtle
	- clam
	- anemone (not certain, might be too many ground creatures)
	- shark

fix hitbox on whale

rename util to something more fitting (maybe separate game objects from screen and time? game.py + objects.py)

even better: remove most if not all global variables that couple components and instead make them cohesive
